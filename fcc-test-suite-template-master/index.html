          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>

        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
          is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
          scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
          function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example
          the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function
          (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which
          in this case is an if statement.
        </p>
        <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
