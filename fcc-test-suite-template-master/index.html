          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
          and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
          structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
          variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
          example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
           
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
           
          </li>
        </ul>
